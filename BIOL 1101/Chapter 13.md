- Gene Expression Control
	- All somatic cells are genetically **identical**
	- Gene expression is mainly controlled through *transcriptional regulation* 
	- Cells differ through specialization by activating specific genes 
- Regulation of Gene Expression in Prokaryotes
	- Reflects life history, as it has a rapid and reversible response to the environment
	- *Operon*: A cluster of prokaryotic genes and DNA regulatory sequences
	- RNA polymerase binds at the *promoter* for the operon
	- Many genes may be transcribed into one mRNA
