- Gene Expression Control
	- All somatic cells are genetically **identical**
	- Gene expression is mainly controlled through *transcriptional regulation* 
	- Cells differ through specialization by activating specific genes 
- Regulation of Gene Expression in Prokaryotes
	- Reflects life history, as it has a rapid and reversible response to the environment
	- *Operon*: A cluster of prokaryotic genes and DNA regulatory sequences
	- RNA polymerase binds at the *promoter* for the operon
	- Many genes may be transcribed into one mRNA
	- Cluster of genes is called a *transcription unit*
- **Operon**
	- *Operator*
		- Regulatory DNA sequences in operon 
		- Regulatory proteins bind the operator
		- **Repressor proteins**
			- Prevent operon from being expressed
		- **Activator proteins**
			- Turn on expression of genes from operon
	- *lac* operon for Lactose Metabolism
		- lactose metabolism In E Coli requires 3 genes:
			- lacZ, lacY and lacA
			- The *lac operon* contains all three genes and regulatory sequences
			- The lac operon operator sequence is between the promoter and lacZ
	- When lactose is absent?
		- *Lac repressor*
			- Stops lac operon expression
