- Evidence for Genes encoding proteins
	- Garrod (1896)
		- Studied *alkaptonuria* 
		- It was a metabolic disorder
		- Produced chemical that turns black in air
		- Inherited --> Alteration in gene that encodes the enzyme that metabolizes the chemical
	- Beadle & Tatum (1940's)
		- Studied orange bread mold, also known as *neurospora crassa*
		- Mould grows on **minimal media**, consisting of inorganic salts, sucrose and vitamin
		- Used x rays to produce nutritional mutants (auxotrophs)
		- Hypothesis: Each mutant had  a defective gene for an enzyme needed to synthesize a nutrient
- Relationship between genes and proteins
	- *One gene-one enzyme hypothesis*
		- Direct relationship between genes and enzymes 
	- One gene-one polypeptide hypothesis 
		- Not all proteins are enzymes, disproved previous theory
		- Functional proteins sometimes contain one or more polypeptides
		- Different genes encode each polypeptide
- Genes to proteins?
	- *Transcription*
		- Nucleotide sequence in DNA is copied into a complementary sequence in an RNA molecule
		- Template of DNA is used to create messenger RNA (mRNA)
	- *Translation*
		- Sequence of nucleotides in mRNA molecule specifies amino acid sequence in polypeptide
		- Ribosomes assemble the amino acid sequence
