- Evidence for Genes encoding proteins
	- Garrod (1896)
		- Studied *alkaptonuria* 
		- It was a metabolic disorder
		- Produced chemical that turns black in air
		- Inherited --> Alteration in gene that encodes the enzyme that metabolizes the chemical
	- Beadle & Tatum (1940's)
		- Studied orange bread mold, also known as *neurospora crassa*
		- Mould grows on **minimal media**, consisting of inorganic salts, sucrose and vitamin
		- Used x rays to produce nutritional mutants (auxotrophs)
		- Hypothesis: Each mutant had  a defective gene for an enzyme needed to synthesize a nutrient
- Relationship between genes and proteins
	- *One gene-one enzyme hypothesis*
		- Direct relationship between genes and enzymes 
	- One gene-one polypeptide hypothesis 
		- Not all proteins are enzymes, disproved previous theory
		- Functional proteins sometimes contain one or more polypeptides
		- Different genes encode each polypeptide
- Genes to proteins?
	- *Transcription*
		- Nucleotide sequence in DNA is copied into a complementary sequence in an RNA molecule
		- Template of DNA is used to create messenger RNA (mRNA)
	- *Translation*
		- Sequence of nucleotides in mRNA molecule specifies amino acid sequence in polypeptide
		- Ribosomes assemble the amino acid sequence
- Genetic Code
	- Info
		- 4 nucleotide bases in DNA or RNA
		- 20 different amino acids in polypeptides
	- Code
		- 1 nucleotide --> 4 combinations
		- 2 nucleotides --> 16 combinations
		- 3 nucleotides --> 64 combinations
			- 3 nucleotides made enough combos to specify all 20 amino acids and more
	- DNA and RNA read in 3 letter words called **codons**
		- Each codon encodes for 1 amino acid 
	- Sense Codons
		- 61 codons specify amino acids
		- Most amino acids are specified by several codons (*degeneracy/redundancy*)
		- Nucleic acid codes are *sequential*, meaning they dont have any commas or spaces in between them
		- AUG = START
	- Start Codon (*initiator codon*)
		- AUG
		- First codon recognized during translation
		- Is included in the 61 amino acid specifying codons out of the 64 total codons
	- Stop Codons (*termination codons*)
		- End of polypeptide-encoding mRNA sequence
		- **UAA, UAG, UGA**
		- These 3 make up the codons which do not specify amino acids
	- Genetic code is **Universal**
		- Same codons specify the same amino acids in all living organisms and viruses
		- Genetic code was established very early in the evolution of all life and has remained consistent.
- TRANSCRIPTION (**DNA --> RNA**)
	- In this process, info coded in the sequential DNA bases is transferred to a complementary RNA base
	- Like DNA replication, except:
		- Only 1 DNA strand is used as  a template
		- It only transcribes the **genes**
		- RNA polymerase used, no primer needed
		- RNA are single strands
		- URACIL replaces THYMINE, (A-->U instead of A-->T)
	- RNA Polymerases
		- **NO** primers needed to start complementary copy
		- RNA is made in the 5' --> 3' direction and the DNA template is read 3' --> 5'
