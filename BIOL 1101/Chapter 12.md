- Evidence for Genes encoding proteins
	- Garrod (1896)
		- Studied *alkaptonuria* 
		- It was a metabolic disorder
		- Produced chemical that turns black in air
		- Inherited --> Alteration in gene that encodes the enzyme that metabolizes the chemical
	- Beadle & Tatum (1940's)
		- Studied orange bread mold, also known as *neurospora crassa*
		- Mould grows on **minimal media**, consisting of inorganic salts, sucrose and vitamin
		- Used x rays to produce nutritional mutants (auxotrophs)
		- Hypothesis: Each mutant had  a defective gene for an enzyme needed to synthesize a nutrient
- Relationship between genes and proteins
	- *One gene-one enzyme hypothesis*
		- Direct relationship between genes and enzymes 
	- One gene-one polypeptide hypothesis 
		- Not all proteins are enzymes, disproved previous theory
		- Functional proteins sometimes contain one or more polypeptides
		- Different genes encode each polypeptide
- Genes to proteins?
	- *Transcription*
		- Nucleotide sequence in DNA is copied into a complementary sequence in an RNA molecule
		- Template of DNA is used to create messenger RNA (mRNA)
	- *Translation*
		- Sequence of nucleotides in mRNA molecule specifies amino acid sequence in polypeptide
		- Ribosomes assemble the amino acid sequence
- Genetic Code
	- Info
		- 4 nucleotide bases in DNA or RNA
		- 20 different amino acids in polypeptides
	- Code
		- 1 nucleotide --> 4 combinations
		- 2 nucleotides --> 16 combinations
		- 3 nucleotides --> 64 combinations
			- 3 nucleotides made enough combos to specify all 20 amino acids and more
	- DNA and RNA read in 3 letter words called **codons**
		- Each codon encodes for 1 amino acid 
	- Sense Codons
		- 61 codons specify amino acids
		- Most amino acids are specified by several codons (*degeneracy/redundancy*)
		- Nucleic acid codes are *sequential*, meaning they dont have any commas or spaces in between them
		- AUG = START
	- Start Codon (*initiator codon*)
		- AUG
		- First codon recognized during translation
		- Is included in the 61 amino acid specifying codons out of the 64 total codons
	- Stop Codons (*termination codons*)
		- End of polypeptide-encoding mRNA sequence
		- **UAA, UAG, UGA**
		- These 3 make up the codons which do not specify amino acids
	- Genetic code is **Universal**
		- Same codons specify the same amino acids in all living organisms and viruses
		- Genetic code was established very early in the evolution of all life and has remained consistent.
- ***TRANSCRIPTION*** (**DNA --> RNA**)
	- In this process, info coded in the sequential DNA bases is transferred to a complementary RNA base
	- Like DNA replication, except:
		- Only 1 DNA strand is used as  a template
		- It only transcribes the **genes**
		- RNA polymerase used, no primer needed
		- RNA are single strands
		- URACIL replaces THYMINE, (A-->U instead of A-->T)
	- RNA Polymerases
		- **NO** primers needed to start complementary copy
		- RNA is made in the 5' --> 3' direction and the DNA template is read 3' --> 5'
		- In *Eukaryotes*, RNA polymerase does NOT bind directly to DNA as it need *transcription factors*
		- In *Prokaryotes*, RNA polymerase binds directly to DNA
	- Gene Organization
		- **Promoter**
			- Directs where transcription begins
			- Upstream of transcription unit 
			- Determines where RNA polymerase binds
		- **Transcription Unit**
			- Portion of DNA that is copied into RNA
		- **Terminator**
			- Signals the end of transcription of a gene
	- **INITIATION**
		- Proteins called *transcription factors* bind to the promoter area of the TATA box
		- Other transcription factors recruit *RNA polymerase II*
		- The enzyme then binds in the orientation for initiating transcription in the correct place
		- **Transcription initiation complex** involved both transcription factors and RNA polymerase II
		- The DNA is unwound at the front of RNA polymerase II to expose the template strand
		- The enzyme then begins RNA synthesis at the transcription start point and moves along the DNA of the gene. (Transcription factors are then released)
		- RNA nucleotides are base-paried sequentially with the DNA template strand. RNA synthesis takes place in the 5' -> 3' direction, making the 5' end of the mRNA the first part of the molecule to be synthesized
	- **ELONGATION**
		- RNA polymerase II moves along the DNA, unwinding it and adding new RNA nucleotides in 5' --> 3' direction. DNA strands reform into a double helix after being unwound.
	- **TERMINATION**
		- The complete RNA molecule is released from the template DNA
		- RNA polymerase II leaves the DNA
		- DNA double helix reforms
	- Transcription of Non-coding Regions
		- Code for rRNA (ribosomal RNA) and tRNA (transfer RNA)
		- *Eukaryotes*
			- RNA polymerase III --> tRNA and 1 out of 4 rRNA genes
			- RNA polymerase I --> 3 out of 4 rRNA genes
			- Upstream promoters
		- *Prokaryotes*
			- RNA polymerase II used for all transcription
	- Messenger RNA
		- *Prokaryotes*
			- The coding region is flanked by 5' and 3' *Untranslated Regions*
		- *Eukaryotes*
			- Coding region flanked by 5' and 3' *Untranslated Regions*
			- With additional control elements
	- Pre-mRNA
		- *Precursor mRNA* (pre-mRNA)
			- Must be processed in nucleus to produce translatable mRNA
			- Mature
