-   **Blending Theory of Inheritance
	- Hereditary traits blend evenly in offspring through mixing of parents blood
	- This does *not* explain why:
		- Extremes do no gradually disappear
		- Offspring sometimes have traits that differ from both parent
	- This was proven FALSE
- Gregor Mendel
	- Founder of Genetics
	- He was the first to use the scientific method to study *genes*
	- He had **FOUR** major hypotheses"
		- Principle of Paired Factors 
			- Individuals inherit two gene copies for each trait, one from each parent
			- Diploids have two copies of each gene
		- Principle of Dominance
			- If two different alleles are present, the dominant one is expressed while the recessive isn't
			- Recessive alleles only expressed when both alleles are recessive
		- Law of Segregation
			- During Gamete formation, the alleles for each gene separate, so each gamete receives only one allele per trait
			- Gamete fusion restores allele pairs in offspring
		- Law of independent assortment
			- The segregation of alleles for one gene does not affect the segregation of alleles for another gene, leading to diverse offspring combinations
			- This occurs during independent assortment in meiosis 1
		- His experiments supported the last two laws
- Pea Plant Experiments
	- Why the garden pea?
		- It was easy to grow
		- Clearly defined contrasting traits 
		- Controlled mating
	- True-breeding
		- Self fertilized plants (anthers produced pollen with sperm nuclei)
		- Same trait in each generation
	- Cross-Pollination
		- Between different parent plants
		- Different traits in each generation
	-  Flower colour cross
		- P Gen
			- Purple Flowers crossed with white flowers
		- F1 Gen
			- All purple
		- F2 Gen
			- 3 purple, 1 white (No blending)
			- 3:1 ratio
- Terminology
	- Homozygous: Same alleles (PP or pp)
	- Heterozygous: Two different alleles (Pp)
	- Genotype: Genetic makeup from parents
	- Phenotype: Outward appearance (purple/white flowers)
- Product Rule in Probability
	- Probability of two events occurring in succession
	- Ex. Coin flip
		- Heads = 1/2
		- Tails = 1/2
		- Two heads = 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4
		- Two tails = 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4
	- Mendel could predict
		- Classes of offspring
		- Proportions of those offspring 
	- He used the combined probabilities of each event happening (sum rule)
- Probability in Mendel's Crosses
	- Genotype
		- PP zygote = 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4
		- pp zygote = 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4
		- Pp zygote = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 (sum rule as Pp happens twice)
	- Phenotype
		- Purple (dominant) = PP + Pp = 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4
		- White (recessive) = pp = 1/4
		- **3:1** ratio
- Testcross
	- Crossing an unknown genotype with a homozygous recessive individual (pp)
	- This reveals if it is homozygous or heterozygous 
	- All **dominant** offspring means the parent was homozygous dominant (same with recessive but vice versa)
	- Mix of dominant and recessive means the parent was heterozygous 
-  Dihybrid Cross
	- Pea shape: R = round and r = wrinkled
	- Pea colour: Y= yellow and y= green
	- P Gen
		- RR YY x rr yy
		- Each produces RY and ry gametes respectively 
	- F1 Gen
		- All offspring Rr Yy genotype
		- Round and yellow phenotype
	- Heterozygous cross
		- F1
			-  Rr Yy x Rr Yy
			- 4 gametes produced by parents: RY, Ry, rY, ry
		- F2
			- 4 phenotypes:
				- 9/16 = round yellow
				- 3/16 = wrinkled yellow
				- 3/16 = round green
				- 1/16 = wrinkled green
				- **9:3:3:1 RATIO** 
- Chromosome Theory of Inheritance
	- Walter Sutton
		- Parallels between genes and chromosomes in meiosis and fertilization 
	- 1. Chromosomes occur in pairs in diploid organisms
	- 2. Chromosomes of each pair are separated and delivered singly to gametes, as are alleles of a gene.
	- Random assortment of chromosomes, they do not affect each other
	- Each chromosome of each pair is derived from each parent
-  Homologous Chromosomes:
	- Locus
		- Site on a chromosome where a gene is located
		- Alleles on different homologous chromosomes have the same loci (think of it as the same address on the identical chromosome)
- Human Traits
	- Albinism, webbed fingers and short-limbed dwarfism all follow mendelian principles 
- Later modifications and additions to Mendel's Hypotheses
	- *Incomplete dominance*
		- Dominant alleles do not fully mask recessive alleles, leading to a mix of traits
	- *Codominance*
		- Effects of each allele are equally detectable in heterozygotes 
	- *Multiple Alleles*
		- More than two alleles of a gene are present in a population
