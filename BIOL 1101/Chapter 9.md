-   **Blending Theory of Inheritance
	- Hereditary traits blend evenly in offspring through mixing of parents blood
	- This does *not* explain why:
		- Extremes do no gradually disappear
		- Offspring sometimes have traits that differ from both parent
	- This was proven FALSE
- Gregor Mendel
	- Founder of Genetics
	- He was the first to use the scientific method to study *genes*
	- He had **FOUR** major hypotheses"
		- Principle of Paired Factors 
			- Individuals inherit two gene copies for each trait, one from each parent
			- Diploids have two copies of each gene
		- Principle of Dominance
			- If two different alleles are present, the dominant one is expressed while the recessive isn't
			- Recessive alleles only expressed when both alleles are recessive
		- Law of Segregation
			- During Gamete formation, the alleles for each gene separate, so each gamete receives only one allele per trait
			- Gamete fusion restores allele pairs in offspring
		- Law of independent assortment
			- The segregation of alleles for one gene does not affect the segregation of alleles for another gene, leading to diverse offspring combinations
		- His experiments supported the last two laws
- Pea Plant Experiments
	- Why the garden pea?
		- It was easy to grow
		- Clearly defined contrasting traits 
		- Controlled mating
	- True-breeding
		- Self fertilized plants (anthers produced pollen with sperm nuclei)
		- Same trait in each generation
	- Cross-Pollination
		- Between different parent plants
		- Different traits in each generation
	-  Flower colour cross
		- P Gen
			- Purple Flowers crossed with white flowers
		- F1 Gen
			- All purple
		- F2 Gen
			- 3 purple, 1 white (No blending)
			- 3:1 ratio
- Terminology
	- Homozygous: Same alleles (PP or pp)
	- Heterozygous: Two different alleles (Pp)
	- Genotype: Genetic makeup from parents
	- Phenotype: Outward appearance (purple/white flowers)
- Product Rule in Probability
	- Probability of two events occurring in succession
	- Ex. Coin flip
		- Heads = 1/2
		- Tails = 1/2
		- Two heads = 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4
		- Two tails = 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4
	- Mendel could predict
		- Classes of offspring
		- Proportions of those offspring 
	- He used the combined probabilities of each event happening (sum rule)
- Probability in Mendel's Crosses
	- Genotype
		- PP zygote = 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4
		- pp zygote = 1/2 x 1/2 = 1/4
		- Pp zygote = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2 (sum rule as Pp happens twice)
	- Phenotype
		- Purple (dominant) = PP + Pp = 1/4 + 1/2 = 3/4
		- White (recessive) = pp = 1/4
		- **3:1** ratio
- Testcross
	- Crossing an unknown genotype with a homozygous recessive individual (pp)
	- This reveals if it
