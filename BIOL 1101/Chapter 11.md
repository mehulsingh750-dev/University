- DNA 
	- The genetic material of all living organism
- Griffiths Experiments (1928)
	- Observation
		- A substance derived from killed infective pneumonia bacteria could transform *non infective* living pneumonia to the *infective* type
		- Transformation would be the process of genetic change
		- DNA of the dead infected cells was the *transforming principle*
- Avery's Experiments (1940)
	- Instead of bacteria, mice were used
	- Destroyed protein --> Still transformed
	- Destroyed DNA --> No transformation
		- **Proved** DNA was the transforming molecule
- Hershey and Chase's Experiments (1952)
	- They used bacteriophages
	- 35S (protein) and 32P (DNA)
	- Results showed DNA (*not protein*) enters bacterials cells to direct the life cycle of virus
- DNA Structure
	- Watson and Crick (1953)
		- Discovered that DNA molecule consists of **two nucleotide chains** twisted around each other into a right-handed double helix
		- *Nucleotide Structure*
			- Deoxyribose
			- Phosphate group
			- Base (adenine, thymine, guanine or cytosine)
	- Double Helix Model
		- Deoxyribose sugars linked by phosphate groups --> **Sugar phosphate backbone**
		- Two strands are held together by base pairs
			- Adenine-Thymine
			- Guanine-Cytosine
		- Each **FULL** turn of double helix is **10** base pairs
	- Nucleotide Subunits of DNA
		- Sugar-Phosphate backbone
		- Phosphodiester bonds
		- Phosphate at 5' carbon of sugar
		- OH (Hydroxide) at 3' carbon
		- DNA X-Ray Diffraction
