- DNA 
	- The genetic material of all living organism
- Griffiths Experiments (1928)
	- Observation
		- A substance derived from killed infective pneumonia bacteria could transform *non infective* living pneumonia to the *infective* type
		- Transformation would be the process of genetic change
		- DNA of the dead infected cells was the *transforming principle*
- Avery's Experiments (1940)
	- Instead of bacteria, mice were used
	- Destroyed protein --> Still transformed
	- Destroyed DNA --> No transformation
		- **Proved** DNA was the transforming molecule
- Hershey and Chase's Experiments
