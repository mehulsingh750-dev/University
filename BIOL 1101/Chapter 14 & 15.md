- Biotechnology
	- Any technique to biological systems to manipulate processes for a specific purpose 
- DNA technologies 
	- Isolate, purify and analyze and manipulate DNA sequences
- Genetic Engineering
	- Uses DNA technologies to alter genes for practical purposes
 - Cloning DNA
	 - Isolate genomic DNA and cut DNA into fragments
	 - Cut a circular bacterial plasmid to make it linear
	 - Insert the genomic DNA fragments into the plasmid to make recombinant DNA molecules
	 - Insert recombinants into bacterial cells and replicate
- Restriction Enzymes
	- Cut DNA as specific sequences in restriction sites
- Plasmid Cloning Vectors
	- Bacterial plasmids that are engineered to contain
		- Gene of interest
		- Sorting genes
- DNA Hybridization 
	- Uses nucleic acid probe to identify gene of interest in set of clones (*Complementation*)
- DNA Libraries
	- Genomic library
		- Collection of clones containing every sequence in a genome
	- Complementary DNA (cDNA) Library
		- DNA sequences made from expressed RNA
- Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
	- Amplifies large number of copies of target DNA sequence in the test tube without cloning in bacteria 
	- Pair of complementary DNA primers needed
- How to detect RFLP's?
	- Southern blot analysis 
		- Uses electrophoresis, blot transfer and labelled probes to identify RFLP's
		- PCR and then electrophoresis 
- Fingerprinting
	- Each person has unique fingerprint
		- Each locus has short tandem repeats (STR)
		- Used in forensics and ancestry 
- DNA tech for Genetic Engineering
	- Transgenic Organism
		- Modified to contain genes (transgene) from external source
	- Bacteria
		- Put transgene in expression vector that has a *promoter* for production of transgenic proteins
- Stem cells of Animals
	- Stem cell
		- Unspecialized
	- Embryonic Stem cell
		- Isolated from early embryos at the blastocyst stage
	- Adult stem cells
		- Replace non-reproducing specialized cells
- Human Gene Therapy
	- Alteration of individuals genes, treats disorders with one defective gene
- Animal Genetic Engineering
	- "Pharm" animals produce proteins for humans
	- Clones mammals produced by 
		- Implantation of diploid cell fused with denucleated egg cell
- Genomics
	- Sequencing
		- Determines nucleotide sequence of a genome
	- Annotation
		- Analyzes specific regions of nucleotide regions
	- Functional genomics
		- Studies functions of genes and other parts of genome
	- Comparative genomics
		- Studies how genomes have evolved
