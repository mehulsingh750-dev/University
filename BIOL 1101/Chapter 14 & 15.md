- Biotechnology
	- Any technique to biological systems to manipulate processes for a specific purpose 
- DNA technologies 
	- Isolate, purify and analyze and manipulate DNA sequences
- Genetic Engineering
	- Uses DNA technologies to alter genes for practical purposes
 - Cloning DNA
	 - Isolate genomic DNA and cut DNA into fragments
	 - Cut a circular bacterial plasmid to make it linear
	 - Insert the genomic DNA fragments into the plasmid to make recombinant DNA molecules
	 - Insert recombinants into bacterial cells and replicate
- Restriction Enzymes
	- Cut DNA as specific sequences in restriction sites
- Plasmid Cloning Vectors
	- Bacterial plasmids that are engineered to contain
		- Gene of interest
		- Sorting genes
- DNA Hybridization 
	- Uses nucleic acid probe to identify gene of interest in set of clones (*Complementation*)
- DNA Libraries
	- Genomic library
		- Collection of clones containing every sequence in a genome
	- Complementary DNA (cDNA) Library
		- DNA sequences made from expressed RNA
- Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)
	- Amplifies large number of copies of target DNA sequence in the test tube without cloning in bacteria 
	- Pair of complementary DNA primers needed
