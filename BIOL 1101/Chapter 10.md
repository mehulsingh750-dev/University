- Genetic linkage
	- Genes 
		- Sequences of nucleotides in DNA
		- Arranged linearly in chromosomes
	- For Mendel's 7 characters, they all assorted independently but this is **NOT** the case for all genes 
	- Some genes are inherited together because they are on the same chromosome
		- Means they are *linked*
	- Linked Genes
		- Genes carried out on the same chromosome are linked during transmission
		- Basically, they are inherited like single genes in a 2 for 1 package
	- Way to break the linkage?
		- **Yes**, by crossing over
		- The closer 2 genes are means they are more linked since there is a lower chance of crossing over between them.
	- Drosphila melanogaster
		- Fruit Fly
			- Model organism for animal genetics, just like Mendel's peas
			- Used to test *linkage* and *recombination*
	- Gene Symbolism
		- Normal Alleles (wild type)
			- Most common allele (+ symbol)
			- Usually dominant
	- Genetic Recombination
		- Alleles that are linked on the *same* chromosome can exchange segments between homologous chromosomes
		- This occurs while homologous chromosomes pair during prophase 1 of meiosis 
	- Evidence for Gene Linkage
		- Using a test cross (Chapter 9), 1:1:1:1 ratio
	- Recombination frequency
		- The amount of recombination between two genes reflects the distance between them
		- The greater the distance --> greater the recombination
			- This means there is a higher chance of *crossover* between these genes
		- To find the recombinant frequency:
			- (Recombinants/Total) x 100
	- Linkage Maps
		- Recombination frequencies are used to determine **gene order** on chromosome
		- 1 map unit (centimorgan) = 1% recombination (recall that greater the distance means greater the recombination)
	- Can genes on the same chromosome ever assort independently?
		- Widely separated linked genes often recombine
			- *Seem* to assort independently, but can be detected by testing linkage to genes between them.
- Sex linked Genes
	- Sex chromosomes determine sex
	- XX= Female
	- XY= Male --> Recessive x linked alleles only expressed in males
	- **Autosomes** refer to all other non-sex chromosomes (22)
	- Human X chromosome
		- Large (2,350 genes)
		- Many X linked genes are recessive traits
	- Human Y chromosome
		- Smaller
		- Y chromosome contains SRY gene, for male development
	- Males only have 1 X chromosome as mentioned
		- 1 copy of recessive X allele results in expression of trait
	- Females have 2 X chromosomes
		- Heterozygote recessive: allele is hidden while dominant is expressed
		- Homozygote recessive: trait is expressed
	- Human Sex-linked Genes
		- X linked recessive traits are more common in males
			- Red-green colour blindness
			- Hemophilia: Defective blood clotting protein
	- Pedigree Charts
		- Shows inheritance, genotype and phenotype
	- Dosage compensation
		- Female mammal deactivates one of the X chromosomes, making the the dosage of X linked genes the same as males
		- This occurs during embryonic development with:
		- **Barr Body's**
			- Random inactivation of either X chromosome by condensation
			- Attached to the side of the *nuclear envelope*
			- It is copied during mitosis but always remains condensed
			- Leads to random patches of cells with **active/inactive** X chromosomes
- Chromosomal Alterations
	- *Deletion*
		- Broken segment **lost** from chromosome
	- *Duplication*
		- Broken segment **inserted** into homologous chromosome
	- *Translocation*
		- Broken segment **moved** to non-homologous 
	- *Inversion*
		- Broken segment **reversed** in orientation
	- Reciprocal Translocation (Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia {CML})
		- CML = cancer of white blood cells
		- ABL gene
			- Translocated next to BCR gene
			- Codes for tyrosine kinase
			- Cells grow uncontrollably 
			- Gleevec (imatinib) inhibits kinase
	- Nondisjunction
		- Failure of homologous pair separation and chromatid separation during meiosis I or II
		- This leads to the production of abnormal gametes
	- Changes in Chromosome number
		- *Euploid*
			-  Normal #
		- *Aneuploid*
			- extra or missing #
		- *Polyploids*
			- Extra set of chromosomes due to spindle failure during cell division
	- Aneuploid
		- Usually abnormalities prevent embryo development
		- Exception:
			- Trisomy 21/Down syndrome
			- 3 copies of chromosome 21
			- As women's age increases, nondisjunction increases
	- Polyploids
		- Common in plants
			- Source of speciation in plant evolution
		- Uncommon in animals
			- Usually has deadly effects during embryonic development
	- Modes of Inheritance
		- Autosomal Recessive inheritance
			- Males/females carry a recessive allele on an *autosome*
				- Ex. Cystic fibrosis, albinism, sickle cell
			- Heterozygote
				- Carrier, no symtoms
			- Homozygote recessive
				- Shows symptoms
		- Autosomal Dominant Inheritance
			- Dominant gene is carried out on an autosome
			- Homozygote dominant OR heterozygote
				- Shows symptoms 
			- Homozygote recessive
				- Normal, no symptoms
		- X-Linked Recessive inheritance
			- Recessive allele carried on X chromosome
			- Males
				- Recessive allele on X chromosome, show symptoms
			- Females
				- Heterozygous carriers do no show symptoms
				- Homozygous, show symptoms
	- Genetic Counselling Techniques
		- Pedigrees help identify parental genotypes
		- Prenatal Diagnosis
			- Tests cells from embryo, amniotic fluid and placenta
		- Postnatal Diagnosis
			- Biochemical and molecular tests
- Nontraditional Patterns of inheritance
	- *Cytoplasmic inheritance*
		- Follows pattern of inheritance of mitochondria or chloroplasts
		- Genes carried on DNA in mitochondria or chloroplasts
		- Follows *maternal* line, mendelian inheritance is not followed
	- *Genomic imprinting*
		- Allele inherited from one of the parents is expressed while the other allele is silent
		-
