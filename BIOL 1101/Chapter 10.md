- Genetic linkage
	- Genes 
		- Sequences of nucleotides in DNA
		- Arranged linearly in chromosomes
	- For Mendel's 7 characters, they all assorted independently but this is **NOT** the case for all genes 
	- Some genes are inherited together because they are on the same chromosome
		- Means they are *linked*
	- Linked Genes
		- Genes carried out on the same chromosome are linked during transmission
		- Basically, they are inherited like single genes in a 2 for 1 package
	- Way to break the linkage?
		- **Yes**, by crossing over
		- The closer 2 genes are means they are more linked since there is a lower chance of crossing over between them.
	- Drosphila melanogaster
		- Fruit Fly
			- Model organism for animal genetics, just like Mendel's peas
			- Used to test *linkage* and *recombination*
	- Gene Symbolism
		- Normal Alleles (wild type)
			- Most common allele (+ symbol)
			- Usually dominant
	- Genetic Recombination
		- Alleles that are linked on the *same* chromosome can exchange segments between homologous chromosomes
		- This occurs while homologous chromosomes pair during prophase 1 of meiosis 
	- Evidence for Gene Linkage
		- Using a test cross (Chapter 9), 1:1:1:1 ratio
	- Recombination frequency
		- The amount of recombination between two genes reflects the distance between them
		- The greater the distance --> greater the recombination
			- This means there is a higher chance of *crossover* between these genes
		- To find the recombinant frequency:
			- (Recombinants/Total) x 100
	- Linkage Maps
		- Recombination frequencies are used to determine **gene order** on chromosome
		- 1 map unit (centimorgan) = 1% recombination (recall that greater the distance means greater the recombination)
	- Can genes on the same chromosome ever assort independently?
		- Widely separated linked genes often recombine
			- *Seem* to assort independently, but can be detected by testing linkage to genes between them.
