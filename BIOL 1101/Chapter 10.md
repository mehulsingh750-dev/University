- Genetic linkage
	- Genes 
		- Sequences of nucleotides in DNA
		- Arranged linearly in chromosomes
	- For Mendel's 7 characters, they all assorted independently but this is **NOT** the case for all genes 
	- Some genes are inherited together because they are on the same chromosome
		- Means they are *linked*
	- Linked Genes
		- Genes carried out on the same chromosome are linked during transmission
		- Basically, they are inherited like single genes in a 2 for 1 package
	- Way to break the linkage?
		- **Yes**, by crossing over
		- The closer 2 genes are means they are more linked since there is a lower
	- Drosphila melanogaster
		- Fruit Fly
			- Model organism for animal genetics, just like Mendel's peas
			- Used to test *linkage* and *recombination*
