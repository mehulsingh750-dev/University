3.3
- Empirical Formula
	- Gives the *relative* number of atoms of each element in a compound
- Molecular Formula
	- Gives the actual number of atoms in each element in a molecule of a compound
- Structural Formula
	- Uses lines to represent covalent bonds and shows how atoms in a molecule are connected
- Atomic Elements
	- Exist in nature with single atoms as their basic units
- Molecular Elements
	- Exist as molecules in nature with 2 or more atoms of the element bonded together
	- Hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, selenium, bromine and iodine
- Molecular Compounds
	- Composed of 2 or more covalently bonded non metals (H2O)
- Ionic Compounds
	- Composed of cations (usually metal) and anions (usually nonmetal) bound together by an ionic bond
	- *Formula Unit* is the smallest, electrically neutral collection of ions in an ionic compound
3.4
- Ionic Compounds
	- Formulas
		- Always contain positive and negative ions
		- In chemical formula, sum of charges of the postive ions (cations) must be equal to the sum of the charges of the negative ions (anions)
		- Formula always reflects *smallest* whole number ratio of ions
	- Naming
		- For metals that form cations with only 1 charge, same name
		- For metals that form cations with different charges, add roman numerals (Ex iron (II))
- Polyatomic Ion
	- Group of atoms help together by covalent bonds with a net pos/neg charge
	- Most polyatomic ions are *oxyanions* (oxygen with another element)
- Hydrated Ionic Compounds
	- Hydrates
		- Contain a specific number of water molecules associated with each formula unit
	- Anhydrous
		- NOT containing any water molecules
- Molecular Compounds
	- Formulas
		- Cannot exactly be determined from its constituent elements because same combo of elements may form a different compound (Ex H2O and H2O2)
	- Naming
		- PREFIX + NAME OF 1ST ELEMENT + PREFIX + BASE NAME OF 2ND ELEMENT + IDE
		- NO2 --> Nitrogen dioxide
		- N2O --> Dinitrogen monoxide
- Naming Acids
	- Molecular compounds that **release** hydrogen ions (H+)
	- Characterized by their sour taste and their ability to dissolve many metals
	- Binary Acids
		- Composed of hydrogen and a non metal
		- HYDRO + BASE NAME OF NONMETAL + IC + ACID
		- Ex. HCL (aq) is hydrochloric acid
- Naming Oxyacids
	- Molecules containing hydrogen and an oxyanion 
	- Ex. HNO3 (aq) contains hydrogen and NO3 which is an oxyanion
	- Number of H+ ions depends on the charge of oxyanion, charge always neutral
