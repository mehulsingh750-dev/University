3.3
- Empirical Formula
	- Gives the *relative* number of atoms of each element in a compound
- Molecular Formula
	- Gives the actual number of atoms in each element in a molecule of a compound
- Structural Formula
	- Uses lines to represent covalent bonds and shows how atoms in a molecule are connected
- Atomic Elements
	- Exist in nature with single atoms as their basic units
- Molecular Elements
	- Exist as molecules in nature with 2 or more atoms of the element bonded together
	- Hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, selenium, bromine and iodine
- Molecular Compounds
	- Composed of 2 or more covalently bonded non metals (H2O)
- Ionic Compounds
	- Composed of cations (usually metal) and anions (usually nonmetal) bound together by an ionic bond
	- *Formula Unit* is the smallest, electrically neutral collection of ions in an ionic compound
3.4
- Ionic Compounds
	- Formulas
		- Always contain positive and negative ions
		- In chemical formula, sum of charges of the postive ions (cations) must be equal to the sum of the charges of the negative ions (anions)
		- Formula always reflects *smallest* whole number ratio of ions
	- Naming
		- For metals that form cations with only 1 charge, same name
		- For metals that form cations with different charges, add roman numerals (Ex iron (II))
- Polyatomic Ion
	- Group of atoms help togther by cobalent bonds
