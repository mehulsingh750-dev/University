- Evidence for Genes encoding proteins
	- Garrod (1896)
		- Studied *alkaptonuria* 
		- It was a metabolic disorder
		- Produced chemical that turns black in air
		- Inherited --> Alteration in gene that encodes the enzyme that metabolizes the chemical
	- Beadle & Tatum (1940's)
		- Studied orange bread mold, also known as *neurospora crassa*
		- Mould grows on **minimal media**, consisting of inorganic salts, sucrose and vitamin
		- Used x rays to produce nutritional mutants (auxotrophs)
		- Hypothesis: Each mutant had  a defective gene for an enzyme needed to synthesize a nutrient
- Relationship between genes and proteins
	- *One gene-one enzyme hypothesis*
		- Direct relationship between genes and enzymes 
	- One gene-one polypeptide hypothesis 
		- Not all proteins are enzymes, disproved previous theory
		- Functional proteins sometimes contain one or more polypeptides
		- Different genes encode each polypeptide
- Genes to proteins?
	- *Transcription*
		- Nucleotide sequence in DNA is copied into a complementary sequence in an RNA molecule
		- Template of DNA is used to create messenger RNA (mRNA)
	- *Translation*
		- Sequence of nucleotides in mRNA molecule specifies amino acid sequence in polypeptide
		- Ribosomes assemble the amino acid sequence
- Genetic Code
	- Info
		- 4 nucleotide bases in DNA or RNA
		- 20 different amino acids in polypeptides
	- Code
		- 1 nucleotide --> 4 combinations
		- 2 nucleotides --> 16 combinations
		- 3 nucleotides --> 64 combinations
			- 3 nucleotides made enough combos to specify all 20 amino acids and more
	- DNA and RNA read in 3 letter words called **codons**
		- Each codon encodes for 1 amino acid 
	- Sense Codons
		- 61 codons specify amino acids
		- Most amino acids are specified by several codons (*degeneracy/redundancy*)
		- Nucleic acid codes are *sequential*, meaning they dont have any commas or spaces in between them
		- AUG = START
	- Start Codon (*initiator codon*)
		- AUG
		- First codon recognized during translation
		- Is included in the 61 amino acid specifying codons out of the 64 total codons
	- Stop Codons (*termination codons*)
		- End of polypeptide-encoding mRNA sequence
		- **UAA, UAG, UGA**
		- These 3 make up the codons which do not specify amino acids
	- Genetic code is **Universal**
		- Same codons specify the same amino acids in all living organisms and viruses
		- Genetic code was established very early in the evolution of all life and has remained consistent.
- ***TRANSCRIPTION*** (**DNA --> RNA**)
	- In this process, info coded in the sequential DNA bases is transferred to a complementary RNA base
	- Like DNA replication, except:
		- Only 1 DNA strand is used as  a template
		- It only transcribes the **genes**
		- RNA polymerase used, no primer needed
		- RNA are single strands
		- URACIL replaces THYMINE, (A-->U instead of A-->T)
	- RNA Polymerases
		- **NO** primers needed to start complementary copy
		- RNA is made in the 5' --> 3' direction and the DNA template is read 3' --> 5'
		- In *Eukaryotes*, RNA polymerase does NOT bind directly to DNA as it need *transcription factors*
		- In *Prokaryotes*, RNA polymerase binds directly to DNA
	- Gene Organization
		- **Promoter**
			- Directs where transcription begins
			- Upstream of transcription unit 
			- Determines where RNA polymerase binds
		- **Transcription Unit**
			- Portion of DNA that is copied into RNA
		- **Terminator**
			- Signals the end of transcription of a gene
	- **INITIATION**
		- Proteins called *transcription factors* bind to the promoter area of the TATA box
		- Other transcription factors recruit *RNA polymerase II*
		- The enzyme then binds in the orientation for initiating transcription in the correct place
		- **Transcription initiation complex** involved both transcription factors and RNA polymerase II
		- The DNA is unwound at the front of RNA polymerase II to expose the template strand
		- The enzyme then begins RNA synthesis at the transcription start point and moves along the DNA of the gene. (Transcription factors are then released)
		- RNA nucleotides are base-paried sequentially with the DNA template strand. RNA synthesis takes place in the 5' -> 3' direction, making the 5' end of the mRNA the first part of the molecule to be synthesized
	- **ELONGATION**
		- RNA polymerase II moves along the DNA, unwinding it and adding new RNA nucleotides in 5' --> 3' direction. DNA strands reform into a double helix after being unwound.
	- **TERMINATION**
		- The complete RNA molecule is released from the template DNA
		- RNA polymerase II leaves the DNA
		- DNA double helix reforms
		- Eukaryotes have **Poly A signal**
	- Transcription of Non-coding Regions
		- Code for rRNA (ribosomal RNA) and tRNA (transfer RNA)
		- *Eukaryotes*
			- RNA polymerase III --> tRNA and 1 out of 4 rRNA genes
			- RNA polymerase I --> 3 out of 4 rRNA genes
			- Upstream promoters
		- *Prokaryotes*
			- RNA polymerase II used for all transcription
	- Messenger RNA
		- *Prokaryotes*
			- The coding region is flanked by 5' and 3' *Untranslated Regions*
		- *Eukaryotes*
			- Coding region flanked by 5' and 3' *Untranslated Regions*
			- With additional control elements
	- Pre-mRNA
		- *Precursor mRNA* (pre-mRNA)
			- Must be processed in nucleus to produce translatable mRNA
			- Mature mRNA exits the nucleus and is translated by ribosomes in the cytoplasm
		- *5' Cap*
			- Adding by capping enzyme soon after the RNA polymerase II begins transcription.
			- Site where ribosomes attach to mRNA
		- Poly (A) tail
			- 50 to 250 adenine nucleotides added to 3' end by poly A polymerase
			- Protects mRNA from RNA digesting enzymes 
		- Introns
			- Non protein coding sequences in the pre-mRNA
			- *Interrupt* the protein coding sequence 
			- Must be **removed** before translation 
			- *Alternative splicing*
				- Multiple versions of mRNA can be produced
			- *Exon Shuffling*
				- Generates new genes/proteins
			- Protein variability = Genetic diversity/ Evolutionary Adaptability
		- Exons
			- Amino acid coding sequences in pre-mRNA
			- Joined together and retained in final mRNA
	- mRNA Splicing
		- Introns in pre-mRNAs removed by:		
		- **Spliceosome**
			- Made of Pre-mRNA and Small ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNP)
		- snRNPS
			- Bind to intron and releases out of pre-mRNA
			- Clip the intron at each exon boundary
			- Joins adjacent exons together
- ***TRANSLATION** (mRNA --> Protein)**
	- This process is the assembly of amino acids into polypeptides on ribosomes
	- *Prokaryote*
		- Takes place throughout the cell
	- *Eukaryote*
		- Takes place on cytoplasm
	- A, P and, E sites on ribosome used for addition of amino acids to polypeptides as directed by mRNA
	- Transfer RNAs (tRNA)
		- Bring specific amino acids to ribosome
		- Cloverleaf shape
		- **Bottom end** contains the free 3' that links to the amino acid
		- **Top end** contains the anticodon 
		- *Wobble hypothesis*
			- 61 different sense codons do NOT require 61 different tRNAs
			- First two nucleotides of anticodon and codon must match specifically while third has more flexibility
	- Aminoacyclation
		- The process of adding an amino acid to tRNA
		- This is to ensure that the correct amino acid is present on a tRNA so translation can be accurate.
	- Ribosomes
		- Made of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins
		- Two subunits: Large and Small
	- **INITIATION**
		- Initiator tRNA (Met-tRNA) which has an anticodon 3'-UAC-5' for the AUG start codon binds to small subunit
		- The whole subunit complex binds to the 5' cap of the mRNA and moves along the mRNA (scanning) until it reaches the **AUG start codon** in the P site
		- Base pairing occurs and energy is *consumed*
		- The **large** ribosomal subunit binds and GTP is hydrolyzed
	- **ELONGATION**
		- Aminoacyl-tRNA binds to the codon in the A site; GTP is hydrolized
		- Peptidyl transferase (enzyme in large ribosomal subunit) cleaves tRNA in the P site and forms peptide bond between in and amino acid on the A site
		- Ribosomes move along the mRNA to the next codon
			- Empty tRNA moved from P --> E site, then released
			- Newly formed peptidyl-tRNA moves from A site to P site
	- **TERMINATION**
		- Ribosome reaches a stop codon, UAG, UAA or UGA
		- No tRNA has anticodon that pairs with stop codon, so release factor binds with A site.
		- RF stimulates peptidyl transferase to cleave the polypeptide from the P site
	- Polysomes
		- Multiple ribosomes can simultaneously translate a single mRNA
		- Simultaneous transcription and translation can occur in **prokaryotes** (no nuclear envelope)
	- Polypeptide Processing
		- Convert polypeptides into finished form
			- *Removal* of one or more amino acids from the protein chains
			- *Addition* of organic groups
			- *Folding* guided by chaperones
	- Sorted Signals in the ER
		- *Signal peptide*
			- At beginning of polypeptide chain
		- Signal recognition particle (SRP)
			- Binds to signal peptide
		- SRP receptor 
			- Binds to protein receptor in ER membrane 
			- Ribosome docks onto ER membrane
			- Growing polypeptide pushed back into ER lumen
		- Signal peptidase
			- Removes signal sequence
			- Translation continues until polypeptide is fully synthesized
- **Mutations**
	- Changes in genetic material
	- Base pair mutations change **genetic material**
	- Results in change in **mRNA code**
	- May lead to changes in the **amino acid sequence**
	- Types of mutations
		- *Misense*
			- Changes a **sense** codon to a **different sense** codon
		- *Nonsense*
			- Changes a **sense** codon to a **stop** codon
		- *Silent*
			- Changes one sense codon to another sense codon that specifies same amino acid, no effect
		- *Frameshift*
			- Base-pair **insertion or deletion** alters the reading frame after the point of mutation 
		- Sickle cell disease caused by single point mutation
	- *Spontaneous* mutation are errors during DNA replication or repair 
	- *Induced* mutations are physical, chemical and biological agents that generate mutations
