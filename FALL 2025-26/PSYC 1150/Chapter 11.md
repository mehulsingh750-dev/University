11.1
- Discrete Emotions Theory
	- Humans tend to experience a small number of distinct emotions, but they can also combine in complex ways
	- Supporters of this theory claim that emotions serve an evolutionary function to help us survive and each emotion is linked to a "motor program"
	- They also argue that our emotional reactions to situations come before our thoughts because the cortex evolved later than the limbic system, which controls emotion
	- Darwin suggested that humans and non-humans shared the same evolutionary heritage as the snare of a dog and human for example were very similar
- Culture
	- Ekman found that 7 primary emotions were consistent across all cultures:
		- Happiness
		- Sadness
		- Surprise
		- Anger
		- Disgust
		- Fear
		- Contempt 
	- Display Rules
		- Societal guidelines for how and when to express emotions 
		- Ex. Boys aren't supposed to cry
- Secondary Emotions
	- We have a wide array of *second emotions* 
	- These are mixtures of our primary emotions
	- For example, hatred is a mix of anger and disgust
- Emotions and Physiology
	- Fear, disgust and anger show different patterns of brain activation
	- Fear is related to the amygdala, disgust to the insula and anger to the frontal cortex
- Cognitive Theories of Emotion
	- Emotions are product of thinking, which goes against the discrete emotion theory
	- What we feel in response to any situation is determined by how we interpret it 
- James-Lange Theory of Emotion
	- Emotions result from our interpretations of our bodily reactions to stimuli
	- We are afraid *because* we run away from the bear, not vice versa
- Somatic Marker Theory
	- We unconsciously use our gut reactions like heart rate or sweating as a signal of what to do next
- Canon-bard Theory of Emotion
	- An emotion provoking event leads to both an emotion and bodily reactions
	- The *Thalamus* triggers both emotion and bodily reactions
- Two Factor Theory of Emotion
	- Two psychological events are needed to produce and emotion
		- 1. After encountering an emotion provoking event, we become alert
		- 2. Once this happens, we seek to explain the source of this arousal and once we do we experience and emotion
- Automatic Generation of Emotion
	- We instantly generate emotions even if we cant perceive it entirely
	- When flashed a positive and negative image, we will still perceive those emotions despite not being able to recall what they were
- Facial Feedback Hypothesis
	- You are more likely to feel emotions that correspond to your facial features
11.2
- *Emblems* are gestures that convey a meaning recognized by all members of a culture such as a hand wave
- **Proxemics**
	- The study of personal space
	- According to Hall, there are 4 levels of personal space
		- 1. Public distance (3 metres)
		- 2. Social Distance (1.25 metres)
		- 3. Personal Distance (0.5 metres)
		- Intimate Distance (0 metres)
- We use *Non-verbal detectors* such as body language and facial expressions to tell if someone is lying to us.
- Polygraph test
	- Measures heartrate, blood pressure and skin conductivity to determine if someone is lying
	- Rests upon the assumption of the *Pinocchio Response*
		- A perfect physiological and behavioural indicator of lying 
	- Uses 3 questions:
		- Relevant questions: "Did you do it" questions, direct to the crime
		- Irrelevant questions: "What is your name" questions, not direct to the crime
		- Control Questions: "Have you ever stole a pack of gum before", Questions to make the subject lie
- Guilty Knowledge Test
	- Relies on premise that criminal knows something about the crime scene that we don't
	- Ex. Show list of items, once of them being present at the crime scene, evaluate responses
- Integrity Tests
	- 1. History of stealing
	- 2. Attitude towards stealing
	- 3. Perceptions of others honesty
11.3
- Positive Psychology
	- Focuses on helping people find ways to enhance positive emotions and build on healthy communication
	- Peterson and Seligman outlined curiosity, love and gratitude to be associated with long term life satisfaction
- *Defensive pessimism*
	- The strategy of anticipating failure and then compensating for this expectation for mentally over preparing for negative outcomes.
- *Broaden and Build theory* 
	- Happiness predisposes us to think more openly, allowing us to see the 'big picture'
- Misconceptions about what makes us happy
	- 1. The prime factor of happiness is what happens to us
	- 2. Money makes us happy
	- 3. Happiness declines in old age
		- Positivity effect: Individuals tend to remember more positive than negative info with age
	- 4. People on the West Coast are happiest (beaches, sunlight, etc)
- *Affective Forecasting*
	- We are very bad at predicting our own and others happiness
	- We overestimate the long term impact of events on our moods
	- We display a **Durability Bias**
		- We believe that good AND bad moods will last longer than they really are
- Brickman and Campbell coined **Hedonic Treadmill**
	- The tendency for our moods to adapt to external circumstances 
11.4
-  Drive Reduction Theory
	- Drives like hunger, thirst and sexual frustration motivate us minimize aversive states
	- Proposes that we always want to achieve a state of *homeostasis* (equilibrium)
- Yerkes-Dodson Law
	- There's an upside U shape between the correlation of arousal and mood/performance
	- As our arousal level increases, so does our performance until it reaches its peak and starts trending downwards
- Incentive Theories
	- We are motivated by positive goals
- Hierarchy of Needs
	- Maslow stated that we need to satisfy our primary needs such as safety and security before we progress to secondary needs like pleasure.
- Glucostatic Theory
	- When our blood glucose level drops, hunger creates a drive to restore proper levels of glucose
- *Leptin* signals the hypothalamus and brain stem to reduce our appetite 
- Set point
	- A range of body fat and muscle mass we tend to maintain
- Internal-External Theory
	- People with obesity are motivated to eat more by external cues, like portion sizes and taste rather than internal cues like a feeling of fullness 
- Bulimia Nervosa
	- Pattern of binging, eating large amounts of food, then purging, effectively starving oneself
- Anorexia Nervosa
	- Societal pressures to be thin
	- 'fear of fatness'
	- Begins in adolescence 
- Sexual Motivation
	- Excitement phase
		- Experience sexual pleasure such as erection in males and vaginal swelling and lubrication (Cramers words not mine)
	- Plateau Phase
		- Sexual tension builds, leading to orgasm
	- Orgasm/climax Phase
		- Involuntary rhythmic contractions in the muscles of the genitals of males and females, leading to ejaculation 
	- Resolution Phase
		- Sense of wellbeing and relaxation
