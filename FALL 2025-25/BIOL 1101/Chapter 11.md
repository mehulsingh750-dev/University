- DNA 
	- The genetic material of all living organism
- Griffiths Experiments (1928)
	- Observation
		- A substance derived from killed infective pneumonia bacteria could transform *non infective* living pneumonia to the *infective* type
		- Transformation would be the process of genetic change
		- DNA of the dead infected cells was the *transforming principle*
- Avery's Experiments (1940)
	- Instead of bacteria, mice were used
	- Destroyed protein --> Still transformed
	- Destroyed DNA --> No transformation
		- **Proved** DNA was the transforming molecule
- Hershey and Chase's Experiments (1952)
	- They used bacteriophages
	- 35S (protein) and 32P (DNA)
	- Results showed DNA (*not protein*) enters bacterial cells to direct the life cycle of virus
- DNA Structure
	- Watson and Crick (1953)
		- Discovered that DNA molecule consists of **two nucleotide chains** twisted around each other into a right-handed double helix
		- *Nucleotide Structure*
			- Deoxyribose
			- Phosphate group
			- Base (adenine, thymine, guanine or cytosine)
	- Double Helix Model
		- Deoxyribose sugars linked by phosphate groups --> **Sugar phosphate backbone**
		- Two strands are held together by base pairs (**complementary**)
			- Adenine-Thymine
			- Guanine-Cytosine
		- Each **FULL** turn of double helix is **10** base pairs
	- Nucleotide Subunits of DNA
		- Sugar-Phosphate backbone
		- Phosphodiester bonds
		- Phosphate at 5' carbon of sugar
		- OH (Hydroxide) at 3' carbon
	- DNA X-Ray Diffraction
		- Rosalind Franklins DNA diffraction pattern matches the X-ray diffraction analysis of DNA which proved it had a spherical shape
- DNA replication
	- *Semiconservative*, meaning the DNA molecule is composed of the original, parental stand and the newly synthesized strand
	- Basically, two strands of parental DNA molecule separate
	- Each serves as template for synthesis of a complementary copy
	- Meselson-Stahl Experiment
		- Bacteria grown in N 15 (heavy medium), bases of DNA labelled with N 15
		- Bacteria transferred to N 14 (light medium) and allowed to grow/divide for several generations, all new DNA is light
		- DNA extracted from bacteria cultured in heavy medium and after each gen. in light medium
		- DNA mixed with cesium chloride and centrifuged
	- Enzymes of DNA replication
		- *Helicase*
			- **Unwinds** the DNA at the *origin of replication*
		- *Primase*
			- **Synthesizes** RNA primers
				- Starting point for nucleotide assembly by DNA polymerases 
		- *Topoisomerase*
			- Prevents twisting ahead of replication fork as the DNA unwinds
		- *DNA polymerases*
			- DNA polymerase III extends RNA primers by adding DNA nucleotides to it
			- **Adds** nucleotides into a chain at the OH 3' end, removed primers and fills resulting gaps (DNA polymerase I)
		- *DNA ligase*
			- **Seals** remaining single-chain nicks
	- Assembling Complementary Chain
		- New strand is 5' to 3' 
	- Assembling Antiparallel Strand
		- The **leading strand** **template** goes in the 3' to 5' direction, meaning the synthesis of the new strand will be 5' to 3' resulting in *continuous synthesis*
			- Direction of unwinding
		- The **lagging strand template** goes in the 5' to 3' direction, meaning the synthesis of the new strand will be the 5' to 3' direction in a *reversed* orientation, basically going backwards (OKAZAKI FRAGMENTS)
			- Opposite of direction of unwinding
 - DNA synthesis
	 - Begins at sites that act as the *origin of replication*
	 - Only activated once during the S phase
	 - Proceeds from the origins as 2 replication forks moving in opposite direction
- Telomeres
	- **Ends** of eukaryotic chromosomes
	- Short sequences repeated hundreds to thousands of times
	- Repeats **protect** against chromosome shortening during replication
	- **Telomerase** is an enzyme that prevents chromosome shortening by adding telomere repeats
	- They are important as they fill the gaps at the end of chain as no nucleotide chain is present to be extended after primer is removed
- Mechanisms for Correcting Replication Errors
	- *Proofreading*
		- Ability of DNA polymerases to reverse and remove mismatched bases
		- Most recent base is removed
	- *DNA repair*
		- Corrects errors that escape proofreading
		- DNA Polymerase:
			- **Removes** distorted regions caused by mis paired bases
			- **Fills** in the gap left after removing mis paired base from the newly synthesized strand
			- **Corrects** the error, using the original template chain as a guide
