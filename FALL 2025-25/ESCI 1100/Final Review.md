	- Channelization - making dams, floodwalls, and embankments
	- Dams
		- Pros
			- Inexpensive, clean energy
			- No green house gases
			- Release irrigation water and drinking water
		- Cons
			- Habitat Alteration
			- Fisheries decline
			- Risk of failure
	- Types of pollution
		- Point source - From a factory, direct
		- Non-point source - cumulative (farm, cities, neighbourhoods)
		- Nutrient pollution - Eutrophication, too much phosphorus creates algae
		- Toxic chemicals
		- Thermal Pollution - Waters ability to hold dissolved oxygen decreases as temp rises
- Chapter 12
	- Marine resources: Humans use and Impact
			- We extract minerals and resources (methane hydrate)
			- Marine pollution threatens resources and marine life (old batteries, car frames)
