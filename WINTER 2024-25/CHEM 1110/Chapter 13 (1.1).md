- Rate of Reaction
	- How quickly or slowly it occurs
	- Rate of reaction is the same regardless if a product appears OR not
	- To measure:
		- Concentration (molarity) (mol L^-1)
		- Partial pressure (p) (atm)
		- Both used as a function of **time**
	- RATE= Delta change of ester concentration/ delta change in time
		- (concentration 2 - concentration 1)/(time 2 - time 1)
	- In principal, using any one of the reagents would yield the same rate.
		- If its a reactant that is disappearing, add a negative sign.
	- Pay attention to stoichiometry as well
		- H2 (g) + I2 (g) --> 2HI (g)
		- If trying to determine rate of H, multiply the whole equation by 1/2
