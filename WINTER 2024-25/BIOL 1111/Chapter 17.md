- Microevolution - Changes within a population
- Humpback Whales
	- Does not migrate
	- Separated from other populations
	- Led to inbreeding
- Phenotypic Variation
	- Phenotypic variation  
		- Heritable variation in appearance and/or function  
		- Phenotypic plasticity  
	 - Quantitative variation  
		- Individuals differ in small, incremental ways  
	- Qualitative variation  
		- Characteristics with discrete states  
		- Polymorphisms: Discrete variants of character
- Genes and Environment
	- Genotypes and phenotypes are no directly correlated
	- Experiments to determine connection:
		- Keep genetic constant, a
