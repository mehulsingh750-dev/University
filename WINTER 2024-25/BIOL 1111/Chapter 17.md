- Microevolution - Changes within a population
- Humpback Whales
	- Does not migrate
	- Separated from other populations
	- Led to inbreeding
- Phenotypic Variation
	- Phenotypic variation  
		- Heritable variation in appearance and/or function  
		- Phenotypic plasticity  
	 - Quantitative variation  
		- Individuals differ in small, incremental ways  
	- Qualitative variation  
		- Characteristics with discrete states  
		- Polymorphisms: Discrete variants of character
- Genes and Environment
	- Genotypes and phenotypes are no directly correlated
	- Experiments to determine connection:
		- Keep genetic constant, vary environment
	- Phenotypic plasticity
		- Same genotype changes in different environments 
- Polymorphism
	-   A difference in the nucleotide sequence of a given gene in different individuals of a species  
	- The gene occurs in different “forms” in the population, i.e., the gene has different alleles in the population
	- SNPs
		- Single nucleotide Polymorphisms (differences)
- Genetic Variation
	- Genetic variation has two potential sources:  
		- Production of new alleles  
		- Rearrangement of existing alleles into new combinations
- Genotype Frequency
	- Percentages of individuals possessing genotype
- Allele Frequency
	- Calculated from genotype in diploid organisms
	- p and q: Two different alleles at a locus
-  Hardy Weinberg Principle
	- Null Models
		- Conceptual models that serve as theoretical reference points to observation
		- Hardy–Weinburg principle: Conditions where diploid organisms have genetic equilibrium  
			- If conditions met, microevolution does not occur  
			- If observations do not match null, microevolution occurring  
			- Mechanism for persistence of recessive alleles
	- Conditions
		- No mutations occurring
		- Population closed to migration
		- Population infinite in size
		- All genotypes free of selection
		- Random mating with respect to genotype
	- Simulation
		- Luck Free means no variation
	- Probabilities
		- AA = 0.6* 0.6=0.36
		- If chance plays no role, it is in *equilibrium*
		- Single locus with 2 alleles= A1 and A2
	- Conclusions
		- 1. Allele frequencies in a popn will NOT change, generation after generation  
		- 2. If allele frequencies in a popn are given by p & q, then genotype frequencies will be given by: p2, 2pq, and q2
	- Research Method (**Important in textbook**)
	- Assumptions:
		- No natural selection
			- All individuals survive
			- Everyone contributes equal number of gametes
		- No mutation
			- No new alleles
			- Non copes of existing alleles
			- Important in the long term
		- No migration
			- No individuals move in or out
			- Assume single isolated population with no gene flow
		- No chance events
			- No random weather events which affect population
			- If population infinitely large, no effect
		- Individuals choose their mate randomly
			- Gametes find each other randomly 
			- See Chapter 17 part 2
		- H/W identifies which is causing evolution, hence why it is a NULL model
- Four Agents of Microevolution
	- Gene Flow
		- Movement of Alleles across populations
		- Occurs from individuals or gametes
		- Dispersal agents such as birds who spread seeds
			- Bluejays are agents of gene flow for oak trees, they carry acorns
		- Migration
			- Propagules - How many seeds are moving around
			- H/W 
				- One island model is when large migration happens from continent to island, but not vice versa
			- If there is a large change in gene frequency, it is most likely due to migration
	- Genetic Drift
		- Random change in allele frequencies
		- Important in smaller populations
		- Reduces genetic variability
		- Founder effect
			- Due to few individuals starting new population
		- Population bottleneck
			- Population reduction reducing alleles
		- It is non-selective and does *not* lead to adaptation
		- Does not impact very large populations
		- Sampling Error and Evolution
			- Drift only happens in small populations
	-  Mutations
		- Change to the double strand sequence of DNA
		- Spontaneous and caused by radiation, hazardous chemicals and environmental factors
		- Deleterious (BAD) mutations are harmful to organisms and their fitness
		- Mutational Load
			- Chernobyl birds were exposed to lots of radiation, high mutational load
	- Natural Selection
		- Directional selection favours individuals near one end of phenotypic spectrum  
		- Stabilizing selection favours individuals with intermediate phenotypes  
		- Disruptive selection favours individuals with extreme phenotypes
		- Diagnostic is the different types of graph shapes
		- Probability of surviving graph is important
In Class Activity
- Genetic diversity is good because it helps mitigate environmental changes
- Lots of variability for amount of generations in a large population
- When you put barriers between populations, generations are much shorter
Part 2
- Non Random mating (INBREEDING)
	- No change of allele frequency, change in genotype frequency (after 1 generation)
	- Bad alleles tend to be revealed more in inbreeding
	- Inbreeding depression (different) is the fitness consequence of inbreeding
	- Animals and plants evolve mechanisms to avoid interbreeding
	- In small populations, interbreeding is difficult to avoid
