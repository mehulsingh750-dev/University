- Evolution
	- Changes in alleles over time (generations)
		- Natural selection
		- Mutation 
		- Drift
		- Non random mating
	- Occurs at the level of the individual, measurement is at the level of the population
	- Natural selection is not evolution
	- Darwin based his theories on:
		- Overproduction
			- Overpopulation leading to more phenotypes
		- Individual variation
			- Variation exists among individuals in a population
			- Variation is heritable
		- He only knew about phenotypes, not genotypes (did not know about mutation)
	- Inference: Differential reproductive success = Natural Selection
		- Finding a mate and reproducing 
		- Maturing to be able to reproduce
		- Individuals with traits best suited for the environment leave more fertile offspring
	- Modern synthesis = fusion of genetics with evolutionary biology
	- Essentials of evolution
		- All organisms vary within a population
		- Traits must have heritability to evolve
		- Genetically based traits are passed down generations
		- Organisms with favourable traits pass them down
		- Evolution can happen within a few generations
	- Misconceptions
		- Evolution only deals with what happens after the origin of life, NOT the origin
		- Evolutions is not about 'climbing up the ladder' its a branch that optimizes species for an environment 
		- Evolution is NOT the same as natural selection
			- Natural selection is the *mechanism*
		- Evolution is NOT chance, mutations arise randomly
			- Evolution is linked with what the organism needs
		- Natural selection leads to adaptation, but they dont specifically 'try'
			- Selection can only adapt to a new circumstance if it happens to be in the genome to code in (Standing variation)
		- Natural selection does not give the organism specifically what they need, it selects a trait that is variable if its in the genome 
	- HIEC
	- Misuse of evolution
		- Non scientists used peoples appearances and 'head size' to determine traits
	- Selective breeding and Artificial Selection
		- Breeding the top 10% of an organism to produce the best off spring for exmaple
		- Human-mediated evolution
	- Natural Selection
		- Environmental factors can drive selection:
			- Limited food, habitat, predation, competition, disease
		- Organisms with heritable traits that provide an advantage, will have a better chance at reproducing
			- They have a *naturally selected* advantage in their habitat
		- Acts on the individual, when measuring it look at the total population as it is relative
		- If an environment stays consistent, *directional selection* will occur
	- Populations
		- A group of interbreeding individuals of a species that live together in a specific place.
		- Evolution happens at the level of populations, people don't evolve in their lifetime.
		- Evolution depends on differential survival and reproductive success:
			- Variation among individuals
			- Heritability of said variation
	- NS leads to adaptation and increased fitness
		- Observation of island populations was popular as it was completely isolated 
		- Galapagos Islands
	- The Galapagos Mockingbirds
		- Four mockingbird species (genus Nesomimus) are all descended from a common ancestor but have adapted to different environments.
	- Adaptations
		- The inherited aspects of an individual that make it better suited to a particular environment than other individuals 
	- Fitness
		- An individuals reproductive success (a composite measure of survival x reproduction)
		- Three aspects:
			- Fitness is relative
			- A trait is only adaptive if it increases fitness
			- The trait that increases fitness might change
	- Mutations lead to Variation
		- Mutations are random, heritable changes in a DNA sequence and it leads to variations in organisms
	- Moth Populations (NS)
		- White moths common, black moths uncommon
		- Industrial revolution caused trees to go from light to dark
		- Black moths blended in, became more common
	- Red and White Salmon (NS)
		- Both had the same fitness despite having a different phenotype
		- Supported each other
	- Generation Time
		- Average different in age between a parent and its offspring
	- Experimental Evolution
		- Using short generation times to compare ancestral and evolved populations
	- The Scale of Nature
		- Aristotles ladder like classification of nature
	- Early Evolutionary Misconceptions:
		- Natural Theology
			- Organisms had been created by a god
			- Species can never change or become extinct
			- New species could never arise
		- Jean baptiste Lamarck
			- Acquired traits are inherited
			- Lamarck believed that as wading birds stretched their legs to keep their bodies dry while feeding, successive generations would have progressively longer legs.
	- Earths Geology and the Fossil Record
		- Darwin discovered fossil of marine organism confirming for him that the geology of the earth wasn't static
		- Extinct: Completely gone
		- Extant: Still living
	- Biogeography:
		- Studies of the world distribution of plants and animals
		- Some species found in similar habitats in different areas resembled each other.
		- This is because they developed the same traits for the same environmental pressure
	- Comparative Morphology
		- Le Comte de Buffon proposed vestigial structures had a function in ancestors
	- Homologous Structures
		- When structures look similar, but not due to similar ancestry it is called non homologous traits
		- Convergent evolution - converge to the same solution, not common ancestry
	- Influences for NS
		- Alfred Wallace came to the same conclusion as Darwin about evolution
		- Malthus stated that gains in agricultural technology can’t keep up to allow adequate food supply.
		- Growth depends on food availability 
	- Modern Synthesis
		- integrates data from biogeography, comparative morphology, comparative embryology, genetics, palaeontology, and taxonomy in an evolutionary framework.
	- Darwins 4 postulates (conditions):
		- Individuals within populations are variable
		- The variations among individuals are passed from parents to offspring
			- Heritability= Vg/(Vp OR Vg+Ve)
			- Parent Offspring Regression
				- Average offspring trait on y axis
				- Mid parent trait on x axis
				- Line of best fit (minimize)
		- In every generation some individuals are more successful at surviving and reproducing
		- Survival and reproduction of individuals is not random
	- Darwinian Fitness
		- Ability of an individual to survive and reproduce in a specific environment
	- Darwin's Finches
		- Peter and Rosemary Grant
		- One of the most long term datasets in science
		- Derived from a central american ancestor
		- Medium Ground Finch (*Geospizo fortis*)
			- Daphne Major
			- few finches migrate on/off of the island  
			- population is small enough to manage  
			- on average - 1200 individuals on the island  
			- 100% of the birds are identified (banded)  
			- generation time = 4.5 years  
			- primarily seed eaters (bigger beak, larger seeds)
