- Evolution
	- Changes in alleles over time (generations)
		- Natural selection
		- Mutation 
		- Drift
		- Non random mating
	- Occurs at the level of the individual, measurement is at the level of the population
	- Natural selection is not evolution
	- Darwin based his theories on:
		- Overproduction
			- Overpopulation leading to more phenotypes
		- Individual variation
			- Variation exists among individuals in a population
			- Variation is heritable
		- He only knew about phenotypes, not genotypes (did not know about mutation)
	- Inference: Differential reproductive success = Natural Selection
		- Finding a mate and reproducing 
		- Maturing to be able to reproduce
		- Individuals with traits best sutied for the environment leavae more fertile offspring
	- Modern synthesis = fusion of genetics with evolutionary biology
	- Essentials of evolution
		- All organisms vary within a population
		- Traits must have heritability to evolve
		- Genetically based traits are passed down generations
		- Organisms with favourable traits pass them down
		- Evolution can happen within a few generations
	- Misconceptions
		- Evolution only deals with what happens after the origin of life, NOT the origin
		- Evolutions is not about 'climbing up the ladder' its a branch that optimizes species for an environment 
		- Evolution is NOT the same as natural selection
			- Natural selection is the *mechanism*
		- Evolution is NOT chance, mutations arise randomly
			- Evolution is linked with what the organism needs
		- Natural selection leads to adaptation, but they dont specifically 'try'
			- Selection can only adapt to a new circumstance if it happens to be in the genome to code in (Standing variation)
		- Natural selection does not give the organism specifically what they need, it selects a trait that is variable if
