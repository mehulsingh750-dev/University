- Evolution
	- Changes in alleles over time (generations)
		- Natural selection
		- Mutation 
		- Drift
		- Non random mating
	- Occurs at the level of the individual, measurement is at the level of the population
	- Natural selection is not evolution
	- Darwin based his theories on:
		- Overproduction
			- Overpopulation leading to more phenotypes
		- Individual variation
			- Variation exists among individuals in a population
			- Variation is heritable
		- He only knew about phenotypes, not genotypes (did not know about mutation)
	- Inference: Differential reproductive success = Natural Selection
		- Finding a mate and reproducing 
		- Maturing to be able to reproduce
		- Individuals with traits best suited for the environment leave more fertile offspring
	- Modern synthesis = fusion of genetics with evolutionary biology
	- Essentials of evolution
		- All organisms vary within a population
		- Traits must have heritability to evolve
		- Genetically based traits are passed down generations
		- Organisms with favourable traits pass them down
		- Evolution can happen within a few generations
	- Misconceptions
		- Evolution only deals with what happens after the origin of life, NOT the origin
		- Evolutions is not about 'climbing up the ladder' its a branch that optimizes species for an environment 
		- Evolution is NOT the same as natural selection
			- Natural selection is the *mechanism*
		- Evolution is NOT chance, mutations arise randomly
			- Evolution is linked with what the organism needs
		- Natural selection leads to adaptation, but they dont specifically 'try'
			- Selection can only adapt to a new circumstance if it happens to be in the genome to code in (Standing variation)
		- Natural selection does not give the organism specifically what they need, it selects a trait that is variable if its in the genome 
	- HIEC
	- Misuse of evolution
		- Non scientists used peoples appearances and 'head size' to determine traits
	- Selective breeding and Artificial Selection
		- Breeding the top 10% of an organism to produce the best off spring for exmaple
		- Human-mediated evolution
	- Natural Selection
		- Environmental factors can drive selection:
			- Limited food, habitat, predation, competition, disease
		- Organisms with heritable traits that provide an advantage, will have a better chance at reproducing
			- They have a *naturally selected* advantage in their habitat
		- Acts on the individual, when measuring it look at the total population as it is relative
		- If an environment stays consistent, *directional selection* will occur
	- Populations
		- A group of interbreeding individuals of a species that live together in a specific place.
		- Evolution happens at the level of populations, people don't evolve in their lifetime.
		- Evolution depends on differential survival and reproductive success:
			- Variation among individuals
			- Heritability of said variation
	- NS leads to adaptation and increased fitness
		- Observation of island populations was popular as it was completely isolated 
		- Galapagos Islands
	- The Galapagos Mockingbirds
		- Four mockingbird species (genus Nesomimus) are all descended from a common ancestor but have adapted to different environments.
	- Adaptations
		- The inherited aspects of an individual that make it better suited to a particular environment than other individuals 
	- Fitness
		- An individuals reproductive success (a composite measure of survival x reproduction)
		- Three aspects
