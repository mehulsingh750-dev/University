- Evolution
	- Changes in alleles over time (generations)
		- Natural selection
		- Mutation 
		- Drift
		- Non random mating
	- Occurs at the level of the individual, measurement is at the level of the population
	- Natural selection is not evolution
	- Darwin based his theories on:
		- Overproduction
			- Overpopulation leading to more phenotypes
		- Individual variation
			- Varittaion exists among individuals in a population
		- He only knew about phenotypes, not genotypes (did not know about mutation)
