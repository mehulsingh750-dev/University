- Mutation, NS, migration, and drift cause populations to diverge and form new species
- independence occurs when mutation, selection, gene flow and drift operate on populations separately
- Evolution is the change in allele frequencies
- Reproductive Isolation: Form a boundary for the spread of alleles
