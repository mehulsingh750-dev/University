Speciation
- Mutation, NS, migration, and drift cause populations to diverge and form new species
- independence occurs when mutation, selection, gene flow and drift operate on populations separately
- Evolution is the change in allele frequencies
- Reproductive Isolation: Form a boundary for the spread of alleles
- Species
	- Morphological Species Concept
		- All individuals share measurable traits that can distinguish them from others.
		- Works for fossils or living species
		- Disadvantages include
			- The same species look different in size and colour
			- Does not help distinguish closely related species
			- Tell us us little about evolutionary process that produces new species
	- Biological Species Concept
		- Groups of interbreeding natural populations that are reproductively isolated from (do not produce fertile offspring with) other such groups
		- Confirms lack of gene flow which is a key test of evolutionary dependence
		- Disadvantages include
			- Cannot be used for asexual and extinct organisms
	- Phylogenetic Species Concept
		- Using both morphological and genetic sequence data,you first reconstruct the evolutionary tree for the organisms of interest  
		- Then define a phylogenetic species as a cluster of populations that emerge from the same branch
		- Can be applied to any group of organism and works for asexual species
- Geographical Variation
	- Populations can differ genetically and phenotypically due to geographical separation 
	- Ring Species
		- ring shaped geographic distribution that surrounds uninhabitable areas
		- They go around the ring and come back to the original place (second contact)
	- Clinal Variation
		- When species distributed over large environmentally diverse area, some traits exhibit a cline  
		- Cline = pattern of smooth variation in a trait along a geographic gradient
- Mechanisms of Genetic Isolation
	1) Isolate the population
	2) Divergence in traits
