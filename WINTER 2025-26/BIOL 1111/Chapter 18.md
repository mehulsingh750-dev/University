Speciation
- Mutation, NS, migration, and drift cause populations to diverge and form new species
- independence occurs when mutation, selection, gene flow and drift operate on populations separately
- Evolution is the change in allele frequencies
- Reproductive Isolation: Form a boundary for the spread of alleles
- Species
	- Morphological Species Concept
		- All individuals share measurable traits that can distinguish them from others.
		- Works for fossils or living species
		- Disadvantages include
			- The same species look different in size and colour
			- Does not help distinguish closely related species
			- Tell us us little about evolutionary process that produces new species
	- Biological Species Concept
