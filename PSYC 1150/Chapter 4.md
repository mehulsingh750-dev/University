4.1
- **Sensation** is the detection of physical energy by our sense organs
- **Perception** is the brains interpretation of these sensory inputs, assembling them into something meaningful
- What we see is an *illusion* as the way we perceive stimulus doesn't match reality
- *Naive Realism* refers to the belief that our perception of the world perfectly matches its actual reality
- Karl Friston described the brain as a prediction engine that makes inferences or its best guess about the world around us
- The human brain chooses what sensory info it uses and relies on expectations and prior experiences to fill in the gaps
- Transduction:
	- The process by which the nervous system converts and external stimulus into electrical signals within neurons
	- Specific sense receptors transduce a specific stimulus 
- For all senses, activation is greatest when we first detect a stimulus
	- After that, our response declines in strength through a process called **sensory adaptation** 
- Psychophysics (Gustav Fechner)
	- Study of how we perceive sensory stimuli based on their physical characteristics 
- Absolute Threshold
	- The absolute lowest level of a stimulus that we can detect
- Just Noticeable Difference (JND)
	- Smallest change in the intensity of a stimuli that we can detect
	- **Weber's law** states there is a constant proportional relationship between the JND and the original stimulus intensity (linear)
- Signal Detection Theory (David Green and John Swets)
	- How we detect stimuli under uncertain conditions 
	- They were also interested in *response biases*, the tendency to make one type of guess over another when we don't know if a weak signal is present or absent under noisy conditions
- Johannes Muller deposited *specific nerve energies*
	- It is the idea that even though there are many different stimulus energies, the sensation we experience is determined by the nature of the sense receptor, not the stimulus.
	- It doesn't matter whether light or touch activated the sense receptor, our brain responds the same way in either case
	- **Phosphenes** are vivid sensations of light that are caused by pressure on your eyes receptors cells 
- *McGurk Effect* is that we integrate visual and auditory info when processing spoken language and our brains automatically calculate the most probable sound given the information from the 2 sources.
- *Rubber Hand Illusion* shows how our sense of touch and sight interact to create a fake perceptual experience.
- **Synesthesia** (Sir Francis Galton)
	- condition where people experience cross-modal sensations, like hearing sounds when they see colour
	- Examples:
		- Mirror Touch: One person experiences the same sensation another person experiences, such as touch
		- Lexical Gustatory: Words associated with tastes or texture
		- Chromesthesia: Sounds trigger experience of colour
		- Personification: Numbers or letters take on person like qualities
		- Number form: Numbers are imagined as mental maps
		- Spatial Sequence: Dates or numbers are perceived as closer or farther in space
- Role of Attention
	- **Selective attention** 
		- Allows us to select one thing to focus on and block everything else out
	- **Filter theory of attention** (Donald Broadbent's)
		- Views attention as a bottle neck through which info can pass
		- Tested using *dichotic listening*, where people hear two different messages through each ear. When asked to ignore one of them, they could not what it was at all,
		- Annie Treisman replicated this using *shadowing*, asking them to repeat the messages they heard. People would sometimes recall info they were supposed to ignore
	- Inattentional Blindness
		- The idea that we are poor at detecting stimuli in plain sight when focused on something else
- The Binding Problem
	- When different regions of the brain process, for example, an apple we are not sure how the brain binds these different pieces of information together
4.2
- Light
	- Visible spectrum of light exists between 400 and 700 nm for humans
	- When light reaches an object part is reflected and part is absorbed
	- White objects reflect all light while black objects absorb it
	- Psychologists call the colour of light *hue* 
	- We are attuned to red, green and blue 
		- **Additive Colour Mixing**, the mixing of these colours, can produce any visible colour
		- **Subtractive Colour Mixing** is the same but with paint or ink, which produces a darker colour
- Eye
	- Structure
		- **Sclera** is the white part of the eye
		- **Iris** is the coloured part of eye
		- **Pupil** is the circular hole which the light enters the eye
			- Closing of the pupil is a reflex response to light/object coming towards us (pupillary reflex)
			- When our pupils dilate, it means we are trying to process complex information  
		- **Cornea** is the curved, transparent layer covering the iris and the pupil
			- Its shape bends light so we can focus the image at the back of the eye
		- **Lens** also bends light and changes its curvature, fine tuning the visual image 
		- *Accommodation* is the process of the lens changing shape to focus light on the back of the eyes
	- Shape
		- *Myopia* (near sightedness) results when images are focused in front of the rear of our eye 
		- *Hyperopia* results when we cant see objects near to us well
		- The loss of flexibility in the lens due to aging is called *presbyopia* 
	- Retina
		- A thin membrane at the back of the eye
		- **Fovea** is the central part of the retina and is responsible for acuity (sharpness of vision)
		- Two types of receptor cells
			- Rods: 
				- Long and narrow, help us see basic shapes and forms 
				- Used for dark adaptation
			- Cones:
				- Less plentiful
				- Give us colour vision and are sensitive to detail
		- Optic Nerve
			- Contains the axons of ganglion cells
			- Travels from the retina to the rest of the brain
			- Reaches **optic chiasm** which splits axons
- Visual Perception
	- **Feature detection** is the ability to use certain minimal patterns to identify objects 
	- **Trichromatic Theory**
		- Proposes that we base our colour vision on three primary colours: Blue, green and red
		- These three cones are sensitive to different types of wavelengths of light
		- *Colour Blindness* is most often due to one of these cones missing 
	- Opponent Process Theory
		- The afterimage of staring at a green colour for too long is red, something trichromatic theory cannot account for.
		- Afterimages arise from the visual cortex's processing of information from our rods and cones.
		- Opponent process theory states that we actually perceive colours in 3 different pairs: Red or green, blue or yellow, and black or white
		- This would mean afterimage of blue object would be yellow and vice versa
- Visual Agnosia
	- Deficit in perceiving objects
	- Subject can tell us shape and colour of object, but cant recognize or name it
4.3
- Sound
	- Sound is a vibration, a kind of mechanical energy travelling through a medium.
	- Sounds have *pitch*
		- Corresponds to the frequency of the wave: Higher frequency = higher pitch
	- Loudness
		- Amplitude of a sound wave corresponds to loudness
	- Timbre
		- Quality or complexity of the sound
- Structure and Function of Ear
	- Sense receptors for hearing transduce sound into neural activity
	- Ear has 3 parts:
		- **Outer ear**, consisting of *pinna* (cartilage flap)
		- **Middle ear**, containing the *ossicles*, 3 small bones that vibrate at the frequency of the sound wave
		- **Inner ear**, containing the *cochlea* which converts vibration into neural activity 
- Auditory Perception
	- Auditory nerve enters brain --> makes contact with brain stem --> sends to auditory complex
	- Place theory
		- Hair cells located at the base of the basilar membrane are most excited by high pitched tones, whereas hair cells at the top are excited by low pitched tones.
		- These cells send info to specific places in the auditory complex, matching the tone with a specific pitch
	- Frequency Theory
		- The rate at which neurons fire action potentials reproduces the pitch
4.4
- Smell is also known as *olfaction* and taste as *gustation*
- Odours
	- Airborne chemicals that interact with receptors in the lining of our nasal passages 
	- We are capable of detecting between 2000 to 4000 different odours 
- Flavours
	- We can only detect a few tastes 
	- We are sensitive to: 
		- Sweet
		- Sour
		- Salty
		- Bitter
		- Umami (meaty/savoury)
- **Taste Buds** on our tongues are used to detect taste
	- Bumps on the tongue called *papillae* contain numerous taste buds
- Olfactory and Gustatory Perception
	- After odours interact with sense receptors in the nasal passages, info enters brain reaching the olfactory cortex and limbic system
	- The same thing happens with taste, as it enters the gustatory cortex, somatosensory complex (food has texture) and parts of the limbic system
4.5
- **Somatosensory** is the system we use for touch and pain
	- Our body position sense is called *proprioception* 
	- Our sense of equilibrium or balance is vestibular sense
	- Somatosensory system responds to stimuli applied to the skin
		- Light touch or deep pressure
		- Hot or cold temperature
		- Chemical or mechanical injury 
	- We sense these using **mechanoreceptors**, specialized nerve endings located on the ends of the sensory nerves in the skin.
	- How we perceive touch/pain
		- Info travels in our somatic nerves before entering the spinal cord
		- Touch info travels faster than pain info
		- After activating spinal reflexes, it goes through the brain stem and thalamus to reach the somatosensory cortex
	- *Gate Control Model*  stated that pain under extreme conditions is blocked by the consciousness
	- *Phantom Pain* is when a subject experiences pain or discomfort in a missing limb
- **Proprioception**
	- Also called kinesthetic sense, helps us keep track of where we are and how to move efficiently
	- We use *proprioceptors* to sense muscle stretch and force
		- The two types are stretch receptors and force receptors 
- **Vestibular Sense** 
	- Sense of equilibrium that allows us to sense and maintain our balance 
	- Inner ear contains three *semicircular canals* which are filled with fluid that help maintain balance 
4.6
- **Parallel Processing** 
	- The concept that we can attend to many sense modalities simultaneously 
	- *Bottom Up Processing* is when we construct a whole stimulus from its parts
	- *Top Down Processing* is when we start with out own beliefs, and then impose them on the raw stimuli
- **Perceptual Hypotheses**
	- When we receive sensory info, we make educated guesses as to what it is to save energy
	- We form a *perceptual set* when our expectations of something influence our perception of it
		- This is a prime example of top down processing
	- *Perceptual Constancy* is how we view the same stimuli the same way despite conditions varying
- **Gestalt Principles**
	- Rules governing how we perceive objects as wholes within their overall context
		- 1. Proximity - Objects physically close tend to be perceived as unified wholes
		- 2. Similarity -Similar objects compose a whole
		- 3. Continuity - We still perceive objects as wholes even if other objects block parts
		- 4. Closure - When visual info is missing, brain fills in the gaps
		- Symmetry - Symmetrically arranged objects tend to be seen as whole
		- Figure-ground - We pay attention to what is in the foreground
- Perceiving Depth
	- *Depth Perception* is the ability to see spatial relations in 3 dimensions
	- 2 cues are used to gauge depth:
		- Monocular depth cues (1 eye)
		- Binocular depth cues (two eyes)
- Subliminal Information Processing
	- The concept of perceiving information while not being fully conscious of it.
- Subliminal Persuasion
	- This uses the same logic except that we are influenced without being conscious of it.
